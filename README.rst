The ``commondata.eg`` package
=============================

`Common data <https://github.com/lsaffre/commondata>`_ about
Egypt. Freely available and maintained in Python.

This currently includes a list of Egyptian places with zip codes.[ The problem about ZIP code that I don't think that we have specific range]

DISCLAIMER: This comes with no warranty at all.

Usage examples:

>>> from commondata.eg.places import root
 **TODO soon**
